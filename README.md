# UBanco

A new Personal Microcredit Platform

## Reason

Productivity depends among many other variables on the initial capital invested. On the other hand, in South America it's difficult to obtain financing to develop a project. Therefore, to improve the region's productivity, we need find a new sources of financing must be found to provide opportunities.

## Intention

UBanco was born as a proposal to facilitate financing. We believe in the region's individual capacity to innovate and grow in a more connected and interdependent world.

## The Architecture

The project is divided into 2 layer:

- Frontend Layer
- Backend Layer

In each layer are the projects that manage the application.
The details to deploy the projects for each layer are on its own README.
